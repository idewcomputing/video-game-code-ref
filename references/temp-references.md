# TEMP - Links to Old References

{% hint style="danger" %}
**UPDATE IN PROGRESS:** This new code guidebook will have revised versions of the Phaser references in the previous guidebook. In the meantime, you can still access the previous Phaser references for creating games:

* [finding and creating visual assets](https://docs.idew.org/video-game/project-references/visual-assets) \(animated sprites, etc.\)
* [finding and creating audio assets](https://docs.idew.org/video-game/project-references/audio-assets) \(sound effects, etc.\)
* [coding game features with Phaser CE](https://docs.idew.org/video-game/project-references/phaser-coding) \(add sprites, detect collisions, etc.\)
{% endhint %}
