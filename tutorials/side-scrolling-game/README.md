# Side-Scrolling Game

In this tutorial, you're going to create a side-scrolling game that follows the player's character as it moves through an extended game world. The instructions will help you make a partial game, which you'll need to finish designing and creating yourself. You'll also create some of your own custom assets \(sound effects and an animated sprite\) to add to your game. This practice will allow you to apply your existing knowledge of Phaser, plus show you a few more new features.

## PREPERATION

1. Complete the [Quick Setup](../quick-setup.md) for a new game.
2. Download this [assets.zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8MTiM_lFG9TOXpWLUVJY1NUMVk) file, and extract the file contents, which will be a folder named **assets** that has two subfolders containing 30 images and 2 sounds. Replace your empty assets folder with this assets folder. For this game, you won't necessarily use all the provided images. It will be up to you to decide whether to use some of them.
3. Test your Phaser game template by previewing the HTML file online. If everything's ready to go, you should see a **solid black box** \(your blank game canvas\) on your webpage.
